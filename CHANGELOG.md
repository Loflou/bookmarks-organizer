### Version 4.0.0 (2023-01-10)

#### Notable Changes

- **Bookmarks Organizer now uses Manifest v3**, fixes
  [#181](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/181)
- **Bookmarks Organizer now asks at runtime for permission** to access all website data if permission is not granted.
  The permission is technically needed to check for broken bookmarks. Therefore, the permission is no longer

  changes via the add-ons manager, fixes [#190](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/190)

  [#170](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/170)

  of extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains, fixes [#173](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/173)
- removed the outline from input fields because we have our own focus design, fixes
  [#175](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/175)
- changed copyright year from 2019 to 2023, fixes [#169](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/169)

#### Bugfixes

- If a bookmarks folder with more than one bookmark was removed the counter of the Bookmarks Organizer only decreased
  by one, fixes [#192](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/192)
- If a bookmark was added while a check for broken bookmarks was already in progress the check never finished, fixes
  [#112](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/112)

  maintainability, fixes [#174](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/174)

### Version 3.1.0 (2019-01-26)

#### Enhancements

- changed native confirmation dialogs to a custom implementation which looks better and does not have the checkbox
  to prevent further dialogs. Checking this checkbox caused problems because it was not in sync with Bookmarks

  [#82](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/82)
- enabling or disabling the confirmation dialogs now has an immediate effect. It is no longer necessary to run the
  check for broken bookmarks again after changing this option, fixes

- **added whitelist feature to exclude bookmarks from future broken bookmark checks!**, fixes

  fixes [#76](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/76)
- improved reliability of broken bookmark check
- added internal option to disable the skip list for testing purposes
- Firefox 61+: The number of bookmarks is now updated immediately when a bookmark is added. This feature was disabled
  since version 1.0.4 due to a bug in Firefox which has been fixed in Firefox 61. In Firefox 60 this feature is still
  disabled.

  circumstances, fixes [#85](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/85)

### Version 2.0.0 (2018-03-10)

#### Enhancements

- **Bookmarks Organizer no longer fails for some users to complete the check for broken bookmarks! A new mechanism has
  been implemented that terminates any request if it take too much time to get an answer from the server**. That's why
  Firefox 59 or higher is required beginning with version 2.0.0, fixes
  [#17](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/17)
- **a request throttling mechanism has been implemented to ensure that Firefox does not simultaneously execute too many
  requests at any time.** With many bookmarks, this can extend the duration of the check for broken bookmarks, but on
  the other hand it ensures that fewer working bookmarks will be reported as broken, fixes
  [#72](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/72)
- **the second bookmark check via another request method was not executed under certain circumstances, caused that some
  working bookmarks were reported as broken. This does not happen anymore**, fixes
  [#36](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/36)
- the check for duplicates and the check for bookmarks without name no longer list bookmark separators, fixes
  [#61](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/61)
- bookmark separators are no longer added to the total number of bookmarks, fixes
  [#70](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/70)
- added a menu item to the tools menu to open the user interface, fixes
  [#65](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/65)
- changed keyboard shortcut to Shift + F11 to avoid a conflict with a built-in shortcut, fixes
  [#67](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/67)
- when deleting a bookmark, not only the total number of bookmarks will be reduced, but also the number of checked
  bookmarks, so that the number of checked bookmarks can never be larger than the total number of bookmarks
- the performance of several parts of the add-on has been lightly improved
- reduced file size of the logo, fixes [#66](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/66)

#### Bugfixes

- **the progress animation didn't stop after checking for duplicates, caused that it was also not possible to delete
  duplicate bookmarks**, fixes [#48](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/48)
- setting for disabling confirmation prompts did not work for duplicates check, fixes
  [#68](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/68)
- filter checkboxes and search field were not resetted when checking for broken bookmarks a second time, fixes
  [#73](https://github.com/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer/issues/73)
